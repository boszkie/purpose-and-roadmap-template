## Phase 1 - The Team Purpose

### step 1

Start by filling in the four quadrant on the left side of the template.

The goal is to be as broad as possible and collect the insights of the whole team. These insights will give you a robust understanding of your **Purpose**, helping you guide your decisions.

This understanding of your product is something that you will need to continuously refine as your product evolves.

### step 2

With the information in the 4 quadrants to give you context, create a Team **Purpose** which is lofty enough to afford flexibility in how to achieve it, while also being concrete enough to be useful to guide your decisions. You can use a technique like [1-2-4-all](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all) for this. Add the resulting text to big green post-it in the 'purpose' field.

## Phase 2 - Concrete Steps

While the **Purpose** will be useful to guide your decisions, serving as your [North Star](https://www.productcompass.pm/p/the-north-star-framework-101), it does not say much about how to achieve it.

For this you need to think about the actual **Concrete Steps** you need to take to achieve your **Purpose**. These steps are the most promising things you can do right now.

### step 3

To figure out your **Concrete Steps**, start by thinking about what concrete, decisive actions are need to achieve your **Purpose** and collect them in the 'concrete steps' field, next to the quadrants.

This is creative brainstorming, an exercise in which you just want to collect as many ideas as possible, so don't worry about things like how big they are and what is required for them right now. You will be looking at all that later.

### step 4

Once you have a nice bunch of ideas, look for duplicates and other patterns. See if you can group your ideas into themes. The goal here is to end up with steps which are grand, exhaustive and independent. Techniques like [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) and [FOCUS](https://mdalmijn.com/p/apply-focus-to-set-great-sprint-goals) are useful here.

## Phase 3 - The Roadmap

Now is the moment for hard choices, because as you probably noticed, there are only 4 columns in the roadmap. While you can easily add extra columns, the goal here is to focus on the best next thing you can do based on your current knowledge, without getting distracted by trying to predict what will happen too far in the future.

Putting it simply: 

- as your deliver your **Concrete Steps**, you will gather lots of new information and insights which will force you to continuously improve your roadmap,

- which makes creating a huge beautiful roadmap with lots of **Concrete Steps** a huge waste of effort,

- and of course, you will be presenting the roadmap to your stakeholders. Lots of **Concrete Steps** will make it hard to explain the roadmap, 

- and once you are forced to make changes based on new information and insights, you will risk creating confusion among you stakeholders and, especially in more conservative organisations, thse changes may be received quite negatively,

- and finally, having that huge beautiful roadmap there when you revisit it to make changes will also hamper your creativity, as instead of approaching it with an open mind, you will be influenced by what you already have there.

### step 5

So, with these points in mind, add your **Concrete Steps** to the roadmap, each in a separate column and sequentially with the first most important thing to do on the left. Try to limit the number of **Concrete Steps**. One is of course ideal, four is reasonable, and beyond that just be very aware of the risks.

### step 6

For each **Concrete Steps**, starting with the most important one, think about the following aspects and add them to the roadmap below the step:

- **Date**: how long you expect the step to take to deliver. This need only be a very rough approximation. It is not meant to be a deadline, but merely to give an idea of the investment required.

- **Value**: the value you expect to get when you realise the step. You can express that value anyway you deem fit, but make it concrete enough to be able to compare steps.

- **Features**: two or three concrete results that you expect to see once you deliver the step. These help make the step clearer - more visible, and easier to explain.

- **Metrics**: a concrete way to test whether you have delivered the step. Similar to the [Definition of Done](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-definition-done), it is meant to create agreement about how to decide when a step has been delivered.

- **Stakeholders**: who do you need to involve? This will help you to clarify the value and how the result of the step is perceived. It will also help you to invite the right people to brainstorm sessions, planning sessions and reviews.

All these five things will help you think deeper about your **Concrete Steps**, so don't be surprised if you end up tweaking them, changing some, merging others and even discarding a few along the way.

### step 7

When you are ready, test each **Concrete Step** against your **Purpose** and its quadrants to do a final check abut the importance of each of your **Concrete Steps**, and tweak the whole where necessary.

## Final words

This roadmap serves to give you context at a higher level of detail. From here, the nexts step is to decide how to proceed. And that depends very much on the size of your **Concrete Steps**.

### Small Concrete Steps

One possibility, if your **Concrete Steps** are small enough, is that each step can actually be used as a Sprint Goal. In this you can use each **Concrete Step** as the input for Sprint Planning. 

Just make sure not to force yourself into this. Perhaps splitting one **Concrete Step** into multiple Sprint Goals based on new information, or perhaps you end up merging **Concrete Step** together. No problem! Be flexible and remember - [*Responding to Change over Following a Plan*](https://agilemanifesto.org).

### Big Concrete Steps

If your **Concrete Steps** are big, then you will need to break them down into smaller steps before you can use them to plan your iterations. In this case you might think of each **Concrete Step** as a Product Goal, guiding your progress over a number of iterations.

As you start work on each **Concrete Step** you can again use this template to further break it down into smaller steps. Indeed, you will end up creating a new roadmap specifically for that **Concrete Step**, iteratively until the work is small enough that you are confident you can achieve it.

Just remember not to look too far in the future and avoid putting too much work into breaking down future steps.
