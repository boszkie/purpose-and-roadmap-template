# Purpose & Roadmap Template

![Purpose & Roadmap](Purpose&Roadmap_v2.0.png)

A Purpose & Roadmap template to help you help you define your **Team Purpose** and help you manage your long term strategy. 

The template provides a structured approach which takes into account the most important aspects to consider, making it easier for you to make choices and prioritise your work. 
It will help you to create focus and alignment in your team, bringing them together into an eager and highly motivated unit.

The template is available in the following formats:

- a [Mural template](https://app.mural.co/template/c39babb8-7d6a-4100-96f0-20d85fc7b69b/39b1b601-583f-4df9-a29b-d1f6a1d3fed2) you can open and save to your own Mural workspace,
- a [Miro](Purpose&Roadmap_v2.0.rtb) template you can upload to your Miro workspace,
- a [pdf](Purpose&Roadmap_v2.0.pdf) for your printing purposes,
- a [png](Purpose&Roadmap_v2.0.png) image file.

The template should be useful for any kind of team, whether you are doing Scrum or Kanban, XP or not using any framework at all. In fact I've even used it to brainstorm home projects and a new company.

For every step use whatever approach fits your team to craft the item. This could just be an open discussion, but you could also use a Liberating Structure like 1-2-4-all. The goal is to collect the insights of the whole team and create a purpose the whole team believes in.

Note that all the information you collect in the template is only the best guess you can make based on the information you have right now. It is important to keep revisiting the template as you discover more information.

Note that you can use this template together with the [Sprint Planning template](https://github.com/ScrumFacilitators/sprint-planning-template), to translate your Purpose & Roadmap into an effective plan for your sprint.
